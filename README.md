# Space Object Visualization & Interaction System

## Project Overview
This interactive 3D visualization demonstrates space situational awareness capabilities using Three.js and WebGL. The application renders various space objects (satellites, debris, stations) in a simulated orbital environment, allowing users to select and highlight objects to view their metadata - directly relevant to Digantara's space surveillance and monitoring focus.

# Key Features
 Real-time 3D visualization of multiple space objects with distinct characteristics
 Precise object selection using raycasting technology
 Advanced object highlighting using WebGL stencil buffer techniques
 Orbital visualization with customizable paths
 Responsive design adapting to different viewport sizes
 Detailed object metadata display (orbit type, status, classification)

## Technical Implementation
Rendering Engine-: Three.js with WebGL for hardware-accelerated 3D graphics
Selection System:- Raycasting for pixel-perfect object selection
Highlighting:: Stencil buffer implementation for efficient object outlining
Performance Optimization:- Efficient scene graph management and render loop
Object Grouping:- Hierarchical object structures for complex space assets

## Space Objects Included
 Communication satellites
 Space debris
 Scientific probes
 Space stations
 Observatories/telescopes
 Spent rocket bodies

## Usage Instructions
1. Open the application in a WebGL-compatible browser
2. Navigate the 3D space using mouse/trackpad:
   Left-click + drag: Rotate camera
    Right-click + drag: Pan camera
    Sscroll: Zoom in/out
3. Click on any space object to select it
4. View detailed object information in the data panel

## Future Development Roadmap
 Integration with real-time satellite tracking data
 Collision prediction visualization
 Advanced orbital mechanics simulation
 Time-based trajectory forecasting
 Enhanced visual effects for different space environments
